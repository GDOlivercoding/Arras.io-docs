  basic/director

the droner branch

by default, director's (and all other droner's) drones circle
around the player, attacking anything close

use left click to make the drones follow your cursor
right click to repel the drones away from your cursor

theres are a few types of droners (behavior):
  - drone:
    heavy (arms race, repr: honcho)
    regular (repr: overlord)
    mini (battleship)
    micro (arms race, vortex)     

  - minions:
    spawner (spawner) - fast, fair health, fair reload
    factory (factory) - slow, high health, above spawner's reload
    foundry (arms race, foundry) fast, high health, low reload, **low respawn rate of minions**

  - infectors
    underseer (underseer) - infects squares
    infestor (infestor) - infects eggs
    pentamancer (arms race, pentamancer) - infects pentagons

drones also have speed upgrades (to their drones):
  - regular

  arms race:
  - doper
  - brisker
  - adderall

regular are regular, they are fine
doper are severely nerfed and now tanks like ganger are unplayable
brisker: whenever you want to play speedy drones, pick their brisker type
adderall: max speed, theres only one tanks and its addrall
it has only 6 drones with poor reload, do not use

regardless of if this tree is arms race or not
im going to give a fair review on each of them:

first, the infectors suck
their drones are usually super weak, and they have exteremely low reload
pentamancer from arms race got nerfed and is no longer even remotely playable

droners, are usually fine everywhere
you'll see a lot of overlords (often abbriviated as "ol")
they are quite easy to play (debatable)
while extremely powerful and fun to play

minions are quite overpowered

for normals, we only have 3 minion tanks:
  - spawner
    - auto-spawner
    - factory

auto-spawner (often abbriviated as "asp") is extremely strong
it consists of 4 minions, they have an amazing amount of health
loads of tanks just cant defend against you shoving 4 minions
down their throat, on top of the auto defending you at all times

factory (often abbriviated as "fac") is debatably the strongest tank in the game
though the drones are reallllyyyy slow, which makes it quite awful
remember that factory cant be played outside of solo modes
if you repel your drones, your enemies will hit you before you
do any sort of damage, if you go with your drones, you just become
a target since you cant move away your drones or youll die

for arms race we also have foundry and a ton of other fun tanks

though the only real playable type is spawner
because foundry has the issue of having a really
low respawn rate of its minions
and factory having the issues i mentioned above

in arms race theres really not that many playable drone tanks (of any kind)

heres some for you since its literally impossible to know by yourself:

### regular drones: Spectre
spectre consists of 5 drone barels totaling to 10 drones
also has 5 auto barels embedded into it, which makes its
base auto spin

you have 10 drones to throw at your opponent while youre
always being defended by a literal auto-5 embedded into your
body, compared to overczar, its much better
jerker does become an issue, so id run some tests there

**fast regular drones: Briskseer**

if you read the speed drone thing above
the upgrade for it is briskeer

an overseer with extremely fast drones
it is still weak due to just having low reload and
dodgable drones

### heavy drones: Headman

theres really not that many honcho droners
headman has 5 honcho drones, with 4 barels
(auto-foreman is also fine)
its extremely strong, cannot be killed with triangles
(drone too strong for any triangle barel)
it reload 80% of its offensive material in one tick
this means you can just go with 0 reload

**fast heavy drones: addict**

brisker + honcho = addict
its a honcho with 3 drones that are really fast
do i need to explain more or do you want to read
those two blocks above?
