factory consists of a singular barel
the barel can yield maximum of 6 minions
factory's minions are slow, with high health and reload
its gameplay (usually) consists of it hiding behind the drones
pushing against the enemy

it has issues in team modes compared to solo modes (ffa)
if you repel your drones, your enemies will hit you before you
do any sort of damage, if you go with your drones (hide behind them), you just become
a target since you cant move away your drones or you'll die

only play factory in ffa maze or such
