name: spawner
parent: director
current path: not implemented
all paths:

  basic/director/spawner

there are really just 2 minion droners:
  - auto spawner (asp)
  - factory (fac)

(auto) spawner is quite overpowered with having extremely fast drones
with a huge amount of health, factory on the other hand, has slow
high health, higher reload drones
