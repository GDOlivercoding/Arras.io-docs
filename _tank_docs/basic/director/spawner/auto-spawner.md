as said in the spawner file
auto spawner is quite overpowered with having extremely fast drones
with a huge amount of health and an auto embedded into it
defending it at all times

it counters overlord though sometimes has bigger issues defending
itself against threats, which is debatable

strategy:
try to put as many drones into the player's hitbox
the amount of damage they do by shooting is much less
than their ram
