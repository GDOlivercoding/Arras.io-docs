name: manager
parent: director
current path: not implemented
all paths:

  basic/director/manager

from director, works the same way but when you stand still for a couple of second
you turn invisible, at least partially invisible

manager has never been a really good tank and is because you never really
utilize the invisiblity much

most of time it is used, it is used for hunting
people use 0099990600 for hunting players
because the invisibility does give them something

if you want to play manager casually try 2288483700
manager just really needs that extra reload
compared to overlord, it reloads 4x less
