current path: not implemented
all paths:

  basic/twin

now, i wont be immediately covering all tanks
but:
  for triple shot, gunner and double twin branch, follow a build like basic
  for hexa tank, visit the hexa tank md file
  for helix, visit the demos file

for dual visit hunter
for bulwark same as basic
for musket, i have no idea but basic build is quite versatile across bullet spammers
