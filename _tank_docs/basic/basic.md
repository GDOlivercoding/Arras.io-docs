basic the tank you start out with everywhere
surprisingly it is actually not bad at all!
its a lot better than some tanks arras has

a build for basic should be like any other
usually with high reload damage, some health, and good movement

heres a quick build i came up with:
  `2/2/5/7/5/7/7/7/0/0`

there is not an exact build for most bullet spammers

feel free to experiment with this one

we have `2/2`, some health, all builds should at least have 2/2, mostly just 2/2

bullet speed and penetration arent really that important, 5 for both for bullets spammers is enough
