The directories below will contain as much information
about arras.io tanks as much as i can write

if you want to add a comment, just DM me somewhere idk
information about a tank will appear in its directory
if its a directory

example: twin is in basic/twin, information about twin is in basic/twin/twin.md

for now, it will include pre mass added information i wrote using a program

i will now add some builds for everything n stuff

this will include some arms race but not arms race builds unless i decide yes
