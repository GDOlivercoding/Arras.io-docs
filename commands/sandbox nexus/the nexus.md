# The Arrasio sandbox nexus

To access this area
run the `$nexus` command in any sandbox
you'll then be teleported to this area

this is a special place where you can visit
other public servers (by doing `$arena public` 
see the README in the parent directory)

the arena consists of 5 rooms, each for each region

refer to the minimap in this directory
each room is a different server

on the absolute top right you can see a red x
there is no meaning behind this x
there is a red barrier to enter that room
if you touch it, you die

if you die in the sandbox nexus, you dont respawn
in the sandbox nexus

the **top middle** room is dedicated towards **Europe** sandbox servers
the **top left** room is dedicated towards **US Central** sandbox servers
the **bottom left** room is dedicated towards **US West** sandbox servers
the **bottom middle** room is dedicated towards **Oceania** sandbox servers
and the **bottom right** room is dedicated towards **Asia** sandbox servers

each of these rooms are a different server
if you are in the **europe** section and proceed to go to
the **us central** section, passing the second dark gray
wall will teleport you to such section

each room has a spawner room, where the players appear, and then the room
with all the public sandbox servers available for such region
