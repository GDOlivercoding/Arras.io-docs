## Arrasio secret menu options

Arrasio has a few secret options
unobtainable by default
this menu will appear as the fourth bar
in the options menu

how to get it:
1. spawn in any server
2. use the `pi` build (the first 10 numbers of pi)
the build is 3/1/4/1/5/9/2/6/5/3
3. after applying the build, look in the options, and select
the "Secret Options" checkbox
4. now there should be an extra secret menu

options of the secret menu:

## Crosshair Cursor
turns your cursor into a Crosshair
a crosshair has 4 lines going through the middle, each at a 90 degree angle
this can be a way to improve accuracy

## Rainbow Team Colors
turns all team colors into team colors
its a silly option and doesnt really
give an advatange/disadvantage

## Uncapped Frame Rate
as said by the description
this option is very unlikely to actually improve performance
removes the cap for the frame rate
by description "Attempt to render as many frames as possible regardless of your monitor's FPS"

## Copy Screenshots
when pressing the "Take Screenshot" keybind (`Q` by default)
will copy an image of the screen (a screenshot)
to your clipboard instead of downloading it

## Force 16:9 Aspect Ratio
no information
forces the dimensions of the screen
to be the ratio of 16 to 9

## Self Centered Minimap
The minimap now shows you in the middle of it
gives no actual advantage and gives a
disadvantage because now you cant see the whole map

## "Brainrot" filter
filters brainrotted words
usually slang words used by generation Z and alpha (and so on)
these include words like "Skibidi, sigma, ohio, fanum tax, gyatt and aura"
might not be as accurate or working
enabling this option is your personal decision

### beta options (newly released, might be buggy)

## Save Skill Upgrades

allow you to save your "builds"
and then load them back immediately

refer to `skill upgrade saving.md`

## Player list (preview)

"Display a list of players you're recently interacted with"
this list can be opened from the little arrow under the options
arrow
