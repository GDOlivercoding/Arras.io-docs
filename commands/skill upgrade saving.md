## Saving and Loading skill upgrades

First, there is no real category for this topic
this is a key binding, and not a text command
but this is the best place to put this for now

---

Arrasio allows you so save your skill upgrades
and then load them, which saves time and effort
here, i will explain how to do this, since its a little unclear

This is a part of the secret menu
which is another unrelated thing to commands
read `secret menu.md` before proceeding
because this is a secret option
which can only be accessed by the secret menu

this is a keybinding, visit the keybinds menu
and set your `Load Skill Upgrades` and `Save Skill Upgrades`

Load = `Load Skill Upgrades` keybind

Save = `Save Skill Upgrades` keybind

usage:
press `Save` + numeric hotkey
this will save your current
skill upgrades to a "slot"
at the index of the numeric hotkey
in total, you can have 10 different
skill upgrades saved

to load skill upgrades
press `Load` + numeric hotkey
if the slot is empty then nothing happens
if its not empty, your skill upgrades
will be (immediately) set to the saved upgrades

### What happens if i save grownth upgrades and load them when i don't have enough?

the upgrades will upgrade from the top
the loading will stop once you run out of skill points
