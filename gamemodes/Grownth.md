# Grownth Arras.io gamemodes

## Grownth tab

the grownth gamemodes tab consists of 
modes with grownth in their name and old dreadnoughts servers (they are grownth too)

---

The main gimmick of grownth is that as you get score
your tank becomes bigger, you get more upgrades, you become slower, and become tougher (natural health gain)

As said above but in a more constructive way, when you get score, you get more skill upgrades, and your tank becomes bigger (grows), making your bullets bigger too

some players also dont know, but the more score you have, the higher your health is too, your health naturally increases, so a 2 million auto spawner with 3 body damage and 3 max health could survive a 26K spike 

with this being, this pushes the tanks of this mode to be heavier, usually tanks with higher damage outputs, popular choices being annihilator, builder, assembler and such, tanks like nailgun, battleship even overlord often deal way too low damage to defend themselves

a grownth mode could be absolutely anything, from ffa to tdms to squads,
earlier today, i have played Europe maze grownth squads, where there were 2 really big players, one of them was sidewinder, the other was an assembler, they had a clever strategy where they would hide in a hole, while assembler made it impossible to bust through

it is very possible to get very big scores in grownth because later on it because much harder to die, most of grownth and score comes from farming the middle of the arena, where the pentagon nest is located

being big comes with 2 cons:
youre slow, and much slower than others
always remember that 2 tanks are stronger than one, so if you get in a 1v2 situation, you cant run away because youre so slow

the second one being, players can sneak under your barel, sometimes you become so large, than small players can hide under your barel, becoming unkillable, resulting in your inevitable (and sometimes) slow death, this invites using tanks which can prevent this, such as auto-builder, where the bullet is still strong, the auto allows it to kill players under your barel, and builder traps can also travel towards the player

## Old Dreadnoughts

Grownth also consists of old dreadnoughts, where grownth is automatically integrated into the mode,
there is a very small grownth cap, stopping at somewhere under 10 million, while that may still look fine, in old dreadnoughts, there are a bunch of "rare" polygons giving millions of score, making it very much reachable, recently a player has achieved 2 billion score with a dreadnought, this just goes to see how much polygons play a role in this mode

Old dreadnoughts consist of 3 servers:

### The main map

The main map where all players spawn, is a TDM server
either:

    - 2TDM
    - 4TDM
    - open 2/3/4TDM

This server doesn't have the "rocks" that you can see in typical 2TDMs

Theres nothing much special about this map, there are a couple polygons special to old dreadnoughts giving at max 100K~ score (in the middle as always)

### The labyrinth

The labyrinth is a massive maze, there are beta/alpha pentagon absolutely everywhere, you can **easily** find shiny, legendary, shadow, trans and rainbow shapes here

they give an absurd amount of score, resulting in most runs having horrible score per kill ratio

you can also find "The cube", it is quite rare but not rare to not see it while playing old dreadnoughts for some time

it is a white, 3D looking like square, it has health comparable to a beta hexagon, it gives from 5 million to 8 million score

There are also the "icosahedron" and "dehadecadron" polygons, they look similar to the cube and give more score

The labyrinth is an open TDM mode, either 2/4 i think but im not too sure, but it can be different from the mode on the main map

### The forge

Accessible by the forge portal from the labyrinth or the main map, once youre above about 1 million score
here, you get to become a dreadnought, once you'll enter, you spawn as an egg dreadnought, a hexagon (TODO check confirm this), like shape with no defense

i have written a file about old dreadnoughts before
i wont copypaste but i will take inspiration because it was fine

you can have 6 barels, either you can have all the same 6 barels, 3 one type and 3 the other, or just 3 and an auto thing embedded on you

**Inquisitor** barel: resembles overlord like drones, one barel can hold up to 5 drones

**Assailant** barel: resembles spawner like minios, one barel can hold up to 5 minions

**Sabre** barel: resembles ranger, reload is like ranger's, mild damage, high range

**Gladius** barel: resembles rifle, is like Sabre, but higher reload, and lower damage

**Diplomat** barel: resembles triplet, high damage, high reload, low range

**Appeaser** barel: resembles sprayer, high damage, high reload, faster bullet speed than diplomat, might be weaker, but the bullet speed increases the damage

**Peacekeeper** barel: resembles annihilator, one big ball bullet with high health, mild reload and slow speed


### Attachments:

    - Mechanism
    adds 5 small autos and 1 big auto embedded onto your tank

    - Behemoth 
    adds a massive amount of health

*quick note: old dreadnoughts got recently buffed making them much stronger than before*
