# Grownth Arras.io gamemodes

## Grownth tab

the grownth gamemodes tab consists of 
modes with grownth in their name and old dreadnoughts servers (they are grownth too)

---

The main gimmick of grownth is that as you get score
your tank becomes bigger, you get more upgrades, you become slower, and become tougher (natural health gain)

As said above but in a more constructive way, when you get score, you get more skill upgrades, and your tank becomes bigger (grows), making your bullets bigger too

some players also dont know, but the more score you have, the higher your health is too, your health naturally increases, so a 2 million auto spawner with 3 body damage and 3 max health could survive a 26K spike 

with this being, this pushes the tanks of this mode to be heavier, usually tanks with higher damage outputs, popular choices being annihilator, builder, assembler and such, tanks like nailgun, battleship even overlord often deal way too low damage to defend themselves

a grownth mode could be absolutely anything, from ffa to tdms to squads,
earlier today, i have played Europe maze grownth squads, where there were 2 really big players, one of them was sidewinder, the other was an assembler, they had a clever strategy where they would hide in a hole, while assembler made it impossible to bust through

it is very possible to get very big scores in grownth because later on it because much harder to die, most of grownth and score comes from farming the middle of the arena, where the pentagon nest is located

being big comes with 2 cons:
youre slow, and much slower than others
always remember that 2 tanks are stronger than one, so if you get in a 1v2 situation, you cant run away because youre so slow

the second one being, players can sneak under your barel, sometimes you become so large, than small players can hide under your barel, becoming unkillable, resulting in your inevitable (and sometimes) slow death, this invites using tanks which can prevent this, such as auto-builder, where the bullet is still strong, the auto allows it to kill players under your barel, and builder traps can also travel towards the player

## Old Dreadnoughts

Grownth also consists of old dreadnoughts, where grownth is automatically integrated into the mode,
there is a very small grownth cap, stopping at somewhere under 10 million, while that may still look fine, in old dreadnoughts, there are a bunch of "rare" polygons giving millions of score, making it very much reachable, recently a player has achieved 2 billion score with a dreadnought, this just goes to see how much polygons play a role in this mode

Old dreadnoughts consist of 3 servers:

### The main map

The main map where all players spawn, is a TDM server
either:

    - 2TDM
    - 4TDM
    - open 2/3/4TDM

This server doesn't have the "rocks" that you can see in typical 2TDMs

Theres nothing much special about this map, there are a couple polygons special to old dreadnoughts giving at max 100K~ score (in the middle as always)

### The labyrinth

The labyrinth is a massive maze, there are beta/alpha pentagon absolutely everywhere, you can **easily** find shiny, legendary, shadow, trans and rainbow shapes here

they give an absurd amount of score, resulting in most runs having horrible score per kill ratio

you can also find "The cube", it is quite rare but not rare to not see it while playing old dreadnoughts for some time

it is a white, 3D looking like square, it has health comparable to a beta hexagon, it gives from 5 million to 8 million score

There are also the "icosahedron" and "dehadecadron" polygons, they look similar to the cube and give more score

The labyrinth is an open TDM mode, either 2/4 i think but im not too sure, but it can be different from the mode on the main map

### The forge

Accessible by the forge portal from the labyrinth or the main map, once youre above about 1 million score
here, you get to become a dreadnought, once you'll enter, you spawn as an egg dreadnought, a hexagon (TODO check confirm this), like shape with no defense

i have written a file about old dreadnoughts before
i wont copypaste but i will take inspiration because it was fine

you can have 6 barels, either you can have all the same 6 barels, 3 one type and 3 the other, or just 3 and an attachment

### The "Droners"

**Inquisitor** barel: resembles overlord like drones, one barel can hold up to 5 drones

**Assailant** barel: resembles spawner like minios, one barel can hold up to 5 minions

**Infiltrator** barel: resembles battleship, but more like the barel of a base swarm drone dominator, has 3 dispensers

### The "Snipers"

**Sabre** barel: resembles ranger, reload is like ranger's, mild damage, high range

**Gladius** barel: resembles rifle, is like Sabre, but higher reload, and lower damage

### The "Bullet Spammers"

**Diplomat** barel: resembles triplet, high damage, high reload, low range

**Appeaser** barel: resembles sprayer, high damage, high reload, faster bullet speed than diplomat, might be weaker, but the bullet speed increases the damage

**Peacekeeper** barel: resembles annihilator, one big ball bullet with high health, mild reload and slow speed

### The "Trappers"

**Cerberus** barel: resembles warklet (arms race), 3 trapper barels (traps have big health)

**Centaur** barel: resembles one big builder like trap block, does not travel far

**Siren** barel: resembles mech traps (arms race), a trap with an auto on top

### Attachments:

    - Mechanism
    adds 5 small autos and 1 big auto embedded onto your tank

    - Behemoth 
    adds a massive amount of health

you should have at least one of diplomat, appeaser or peacekeeper barel otherwise you are a massive target, you have no way to defend yourself, especially in maze

trap barels are usually not enough, though a centaur barel might be debatable

dreadnoughts are extremely slow, this means you rely on your bare strengh to survive

popular picks being:

    - diplomat mechanism
    The best for maze, arguable has the most amount of focused fire

    - diplomat sabre
    Another one good for maze, can defend itself against threats while being able to shoot through the corner of walls with its sabre barel

    - Inquisitor/Assailant
    They have no defense. For the main map, requires another dreadnought to defend it, since these two guys got especially buffed, they can be quite annoying

There aren't really any "super bad ones", though one of the worst picks could be Assailant/Inquisitor/Infiltrator mechanism, since you have much less drone stuff to attack and less to defend, though mechanism does stuff, just trust me bro, dont pick these if you wanna have fun playing

Anything that doesn't have a drone barel (or a sniper barel), is gonna be quite stale, super slow, unable to kill a soul, farming shapes in labyrinth

try bullet spammer + sniper/droner
most of the time that will do

doing bullet spammer + mechanism is never bad, its about you, you the person playing having fun!

i dont know why you would ever use behemoth, if you already dont have enough damage then why make yourself tougher? Though using with peacekeeper might make it like annihilator in labyrinth

forgor to add the peakest normal tanks

## Peakest normal tanks

Best normal tanks include:

    - Annihilator
    The best by far, fast, strong, best to kill dreads, best in labyrinth, might be weak in open space (main map), this tank was used to achive the first 1 billion score in old dreadnoughts with a normal tank

    - Fork
    There's not much reason to play fork, it is weaker than annihilator, and does not do a better job at killing dreadnoughts, its still one of the top choices for a reason

    - Phoenix
    Phoenix is known absolutely everything to be extreme strong, super fast, with a really strong barel for a normal tank, same for old dreadnoughts

    - Booster
    Not to kill dreadnoughts, but bully small tanks, the grownth cap for olds is so well made for booster, it is faster than most tanks while having an anormous amount of health and damage

    - James the Machine gunner
    Just, the amount of damage it does, just that, good for destroying polygons, fighting against dreadnoughts, it just is
