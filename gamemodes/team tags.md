# Team Tags

Team Tags are names which define who your enemy and who your friend is 
Every mode has one of these, except for Misc tags

## TDM

if you've ever wondered tdm means `team death match`

consists of x amount of teams infinitely fighting each other
they have either bases in each corner (4TDM) or one on the right
and left (2TDM)

might be 2/3/4TDM

3TDMS follow under

## Open

Open can only be added to TDMs
making a TDM mode "open" removes
the bases where the tanks can be afk
"3TDM" can only be open
you spawn randomly on an open/maze map
on a team

## FFA

FFA (free for all)
all players are against each other
you cannot save in this mode
you do not have any teamates in this mode

## Squads

in squads you can have up to 3 teammates (4 players in a team in total)
there are no bases to hide in
you may randomly spawn in a squad
press `f` or your ability keybind to make your squad private/public
when it is private, nobody except people with a link can join
(copy link from the url bar)
and you respawn back in the team
if its public, anyone can join, and you are not guaranteed to respawn
in the squad

## Duos

Duos are the same above except you have a duo or a partner
(2 player in a duo)
how could this get any more complicated

## Clan Wars

you may put square brackets in your name []
and put in some text, if a player shares that text
you are in their team
you may change your clan in the main menu
or using the ``$clan`` command

popular clans being:

    - [base]
    - [kpk] or [KPK] (if you are a fan of kepikgamer, join kepikcord to play in his private clan!)

    - [wing]
    - [cool] (disowned)
    - lunar, the tag is private

theres no really limitation to what clan you can make

you can just use a custom tag and ask people to use it 

also people often ask **how to make a clan**, there are already so many clan tags available, all you have to do is make that your property, usually make a discord and promote that tag to be yours

in most clan wars, [kpk] and [base] are always going to have a lot of players
