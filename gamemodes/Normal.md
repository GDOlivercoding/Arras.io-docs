# Normal Arras.io gamemodes

## Normal tab

the normal tab of every region
always contains a nexus 
and Europe has a labyrinth always opened
the Europe labyrinth can only be accessed
from the bottom left section of the Europe
nexus when you have over level 60

### what about it?

Normal arras.io gamemodes, the standard
no extra gimmicks, just the pure game

to indentify a normal gamemode, it has to be accessible from a nexus server
in normal gamemodes (not arms race), you have access to 126 unique tanks

Normal modes are also accessible by dreadnoughts, a very controversial update
since dreadnoughts are much stronger than regular tanks
they "ruin" normal modes because they make servers completely unplayable
you may attempt to kill them with tanks like annihilator, fork or pentashot
not all dreadnoughts are killable, especially when there is a lot of them

Normal gamemodes can be:
4TDM, 2TDM, Maze ffa, Clan wars, squads, duos and on
anything without the special tags such as arms race, grownth, assault and such
