# Others

all other modes that:

    - arent accessible from nexus
    - arent arms race nor grownth
    - dont necessarily define your team
    - often minigames

TODO: add maze

## Outbreak

in outbreak, when you kill a tank, it will become a zombie, once you kill it, you get the actual score, all zombies are in the same team

interestingly enough, necromancer can revive zombies
if a necromancer (specifically only this tank, even in arms race) kills a zombie, it will revive it, the tank's body color will appear grayish as its barel, spinning slowly with spawn protection, once someone respawns or spawns in the game, they might spawn as this revived zombie, they keep the name, score, tank and build of the zombie and become a teamate of the necromancer, **regardless of the team of the mode**

for example in ffa you can make teammates like this
because necromancer is so weak you usually want to do this with a rammer necromancer

## Assault

in assault, there are two teams, blue and green
green has either 4 dominators and 1 sanctuary or 4 sanctuary

a dominator is a static, big tank, with loads of health

there are 3 types of a dominator:

    - trapper
    has 8 trapper barels iirc, easiest to dealt with but much harder when someone is defending, because it also defends them

    - gunner
    has 4 small machine gunner like gunner dispensers in a barel, can be annoying to deal with, but with the release of fork, no more

    - annihilator
    1 annihilator barel, the bullet is quite slow and easily dodgable, id argue easier to kill than the trapper one

a sanctuary is a trapper dominator with a 3 healing (or any amount i dont remember) barels, it is harder to deal with, especially with someone being protected and healed by the sanctuary

the goal of blue is to destroy all of green's dominators before the time runs out, and green's goal is to defend the dominators for that time limit

assault always has a maze layout, and you can find the name at the bottom right if you press `L` to view extra info

i remember:

    - lines
    - branches
    - stronghold
    - ????
    - ???????

i dont remember much 3:

if green has 5 dominators:
blue has to destroy 2 then the sanctury will be unlocked (will be able to be damaged) and then destroy the sanctuary

the sanctuary is usually located the deepest in the maze

to lock the sanctuary again, green has to repair all dominators

if green has 4 santuaries then respectfully, if youre playing as blue, youre fucked, they are extremely hard to kill, and just one single player defending makes it literally impossible, if youre playing as green and you have 4 sanctuaries, pick a glass factory build and just camp the sanctuary closest to the enemy, they literally cant kill you, nor the sanctuary

## Domination

very rarely can you see domination

domination consist of TDM
usually 2 teams, rarely 4, and never 3

in 2TDM, there are 4 dominators, each in one corner close to the center, first team to capture them all wins, when you start, they are yellow, they belong to the polygons team, the color that lands the final hit gets the dominator, if a team's dominator is killed, it turns back to yellow

in 4TDM there are 9 dominators, 

top left, top middle, top right,
left middle, absolute middle, right middle,
bottom left, bottom middle and bottom right

first team to capture 4 dominators wins

if youre a big fan of domination, it is very rare to see domination in arras, try playing diep.io, they have very active domination there

## Siege

in siege, all players are in the same team, they fight against bosses for eternity until they lose

they have 4 sanctuaries, the player's goal is to survive as long as possible

once all 4 sanctuaries are dead, and its been a minute or all players are dead too, the players lose

there is a red line from which the bosses come, waves of bosses are annouced, bosses get stronger and stronger, sanctuaries also upgrade

the only modifier you can put on siege is arms race, bosses do not become arms race bosses

## Magic Maze

i almost forgot!!

magic maze consists of a big maze filled with walls of almost any type (read `sandbox/types and colors/wall_types.md`)

magic maze? well the maze walls move! they move randomly, they might trap you or reveal a path to a weak enemy

magic maze also has the magic in form of relics, special to magic maze you can find relics, they look like normal shapes in a cage, square, triangle and pentagon relics

they can give from 500K score to 50 million!!!

usually the team mode of magic maze is ffa (maze)
might be arms race, rarely ive seen clan wars, so it might also be duos and squads

## Trainwars

Trainwars....
they are no longer accessible
it was great while it lasted............
i didnt get to play it though..

trainwars have teams like squads
except the player count per team is unknown

there is one player who can move freely which is at the front of the train, all other players cannot move and will automatically follow the front player like a snake

this wasnt a bad mode at all and i dont know why it got removed, it kind of forced your team into teamwork lol

you should try googling `corrupt x trainwars` to see some videos of it, ill add a link here tomorrow
