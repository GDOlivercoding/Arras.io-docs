## Arras.io gamemodes

A directory decided towards explaining and covering all of arras.io's gamemodes
such as "arms race", "grownth", "assault", "skinwalkers", "outbreak", "trainwars" and more

in this file, i'd like to cover the main menu
you have 2 row of options: region and gamemode

## Region row

there are 5 regions in arras.io servers:

    - Europe
    - US Central
    - US West
    - Oceania
    - Asia

*quick note: there are some plans by the developer to remove asia servers but we are not sure*

the region row has 4 options:

All - display all servers

Europe - Europe servers

USA - US Central and West servers

Asia - Asia and Oceania servers


in which region the server youre playing on is
may affect your ping, and some servers are more active than others
Europe and USA are servers are usually more active than Asia and Ocenia servers

## Gamemode row

The gamemode row consists of 5 options:

All - display all gamemodes
Normal - Accesible from nexus 
Arms Race - Contain the arms race "tag", in normal modes you have 126 unique tanks
    in arms race there is over a thousand unique tanks

Grownth - Contain the grownth tag or is an old dreadnoughts server (old dreads are also grownth)
Other - no grownth or arms race, not accessible from nexus, usually a minigame

Gamemodes massively change how you play, adding some extra gimmicks
and thats why we here today, to find out what all of them are
