## Walls

All wall types:

### gray (regular)

it acts like a normal wall, when bumping into it, wont let you pass
bullets/traps/drones die when they hit a wall
by default, it is light gray

can be found in maze arenas and in nexus

### red

when touched, deals huge amount of damage               
to a glass tank (no health skills), dealls              
half of their health, to higher health tanks         
this should be slight

this wall can only be found in magic maze
often being a menace, killing players while moving

### green

when touched, heals you up fully
you can stay next to it to ignore damage dealt to you

cant be found anywhere as it is too overpowered

### black 

when touched, bounces you off
also bounces off bullets/traps/
drones, can increase lifetime of
bullets, and can be used to make
trickshots in magic maze with
annihilator, since the speed
increases the damage of the bullet

can only be found in magic maze

### pink

when touched, makes you bigger
can only be found in magic maze

### cyan

when touched, makes you smaller
can only be found in magic maze

### yellow eye 

when near, increases your vision
tremedously, as said in the 
zoom-out bind, this is a huge advantage
for drone tanks

can only be found in magic maze

### the 4 gray arrow walls

they are dark gray with a lighter arrow in the middle
if you touch the wall from the opposite side
of where the arrow is pointing
the wall with move you through it, in the direction its pointing
can be tricky and fun

can only be found in magic maze

### white

i'd say the opposite of the black wall
instead of repelling matter away from it
it pulls everything towards it
when you touch it, the wall will force you 
stuck next to it
this also happens to players, polygons bullets
traps and drones, and probably bosses too
the way to escape is to have an adjacent wall
the forcibly move towards the adjacent wall
this wall can put you in horrible situations 
where youre completely stuck unable to move

can only be found in magic maze

### gray (fake)

looks the same as the regular gray wall buts its fake!
players in the wall are slightly faded
their health bars and names are invisible
all bullets fired initially inside the wall are slowed down 
if youre in a fake wall and touch a solid wall you take damage (bug)
theres no way to distinguish the fake from the regular one

appart from:
    - shooting into it
    - walking into it

can only be found in magic maze

### any colored, look like a big beta square

this is a coloring wall
when you touch it
it turns you into its color
you can change it using the `sandbox+c` bind
info in the file in this directory
cannot be found anywhere
act likes a normal wall appart from the coloring
changing the color of the player doesnt affect anything
except.....

### faded, any colored, look like a big beta square

the brother of the wall above
if you match the wall's color
you can go through it
if you don't it acts like a normal wall to you
you can make team bases like this
again you can change its colored with `sandbox+c`
cannot be found anywhere

### usually red, got a square inside of it

this is a strange wall
a solid wall
when touched, colors all surrounding walls
with your coloring, including itself
when you change color after touching it
the walls will copy
no real purpose
changing your own colored can change its behavior
cannot be found anywhere

### faded red one

another strange wall
acts like a faded red wall
maybe thats the whole thing
or theres something to it
cannot be found anywhere

### any colored, has a square in it, and another square filled black

this is a portal wall!
how exciting i know right!
not solid

place 2 or more walls with the same color
entering the black area will teleport you to the other wall
if theres more than 2, it teleports in order
colors does affect this wall's behavior
if theres no other wall with the same color
a popup will appear saying "There is no portal to travel to."
theres no limit how far you can travel with portal walls
cannot be found anywhere

### outer green, big white-filled square in it

this is a respawn setter wall
not solid
touch the inner white area to set your spawn in the center
of the wall
overrides $arena spawnpoint
overrides any respawn setter walls prior to touching one
