# Arras.io wall and shape types

in arras, walls and polygons can have types

walls have one singular type which controls their static behavior

polygons have size (regular, beta, alpha, omega and crasher), 
rarity (shiny, legendary, shadow, rainbow, trans etc.) 
and type (egg, square, triangle, pentagon and hexagon)

to change a type, we use the `sandbox+y` keybind
this may vary based on if you have a qwertz or qwerty keyboard

hover your cursor a polygon or wall, then hold the keybind and move around your mouse
each angle around the entity represents a certain type

after choosing a type, release y first then sandbox

you can find the wall types and color types in files of this directory
