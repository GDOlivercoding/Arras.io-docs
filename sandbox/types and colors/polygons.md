# Arras.io polygons types, sizes and rarities

using the `sandbox+y` bind you can set properties of polygons

(read the README file first pls)

if you move your cursor from right to left you can change the size 
moving from diagonal top left to bottom right changes the rarity
moving from diagonal bottom left to top right you can change the type

if you for example want an alpha legendary pentagon
go one by one
make it a pentagon
then alpha
then legendary

this is not hard, just a few seconds/minutes to learn
