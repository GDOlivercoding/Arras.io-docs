# The skill subcommand

**i will be refering to sandbox+s as skill to make it shorter and easier to read**

## Reset skills
bind: skill+r

will reset all of your skills
will reset the skill cap to 9
and remove all of your skills
this way you dont always have
to kill your tank to change
your build!

## Clear skills
bind: skill+c

will clear all of your skills
will keep the skill cap
but will remove all of your skills

i cant think of a situation where this would be useful
because `Reset skills` probably does the same in most
situations

## Maximize skills
bind: skill+m

will maximize all of your skills
will fill all of your skills up to the skill cap
doing this after resetting your skills will
cause you to have the 9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9 build

## Remove skill point
bind: skill+d

will remove a singular skill point
for example at the start you have 42 skills to spend
press this once makes that 41 temporarily
you can hold this to remove all of your skill point
if you have no skill points remaining, nothing will happen

## Add skill point
bind: skill+f

refer to the above
will add a singular skill point
for example at the start you have 42 skills to spend
press this once makes that 43 temporarily
you can hold this to add infinite amount of skill points
this can go up to infinity (not) you just wont have
a way to spend them

## Reduce skill cap
bind: skill+g

will reduce the skill cap
be default all skills can go up to 9
this can reduce that
yes, you can have the skill cap at 0
and youre not able to upgrade anything
its a little silly

## Increase skill cap
bind: skill+h

will increase the skill cap
the skill cap can go up to 20
skills upgraded up to 20 will
be stronger than skills upgraded up to 9
for smashers (not auto-smashers)
the bullet skills will appear
without them doing anything
likely not a bug
