Here i'll try to cover as much as possible from the first day of the halloween event

the halloween event is happening from 3.10. (today) to 6.11.

you can play this mode on #ot, #ct and #et servers

you can find this mode in the arms race tab of oceania, europe and us central regions

the mode of this event is arms race outbreak ffa

the bottom is a normal empty arena, here, your can try to score with tanks that benefit in open space, though bosses mostly spawn here and most zombie hordes are here too

there is a "mansion" in the middle part of the map, it is a custom made maze, it has 3 portals inside of it, i recon they are different across each region and will shuffle when the server closes, they work like they would work inside a sandbox, if youre unfamiliar will sandbox, or just the wall, you can checkout my version of sandbox and commands documentation here , the more interesting thing are the generators, more specifically the light generators, there are two "light generators", on the eastern side, and one on the western side, by default they are both green, and they look like dominators in assault as if they were captured by blue, except they look green

if you kill one (they have no defense except you ramming them), it disappears, and reappears somewhere on the side it was killed, it becomes red, now the generator is powered off, this means, on that side of the map, your vision is limited, if you kill a generator while its red, you power on the "generator" again and now youre able to see properly again

the way limited vision works is a little bit complicated: first, outside of the mansion, youre able to see everything within you fov, if you're inside the mansion, first, you have a little circle around yourself which you can see, then you can see towards the direction of your cursor, until the end of your fov, this makes it kinda funny, where you have to keep circling around in the mansion to see if anyones around, anyway then comes your barels, or canons however you like to call them, there is a little area near your barels which you can see around, the longer the barel the bigger the visible area gets and last, dominators and opened doors are always visible too

buttons, lets talk about those weird red, green and yellow smashers, like why cant i kill them? if youre unfamiliar with these, these are buttons, you could've seen them in nexuses before, but now they're gone, buttons are like doors, if its red, you can open that door, if its green, you can hit it, and a wall nearby disappears and you're able to pass through it, now i was lying before, the generators dont spawn randomly, they have 3 places where they can spawn (on each side) all of those are in a room, only accesible by button doors, it can happen, that you cant get inside, in order to fix that, you need to use the crowbar branch to hit the inside button from outside, specifically wrench

last mystery, orang tanks? i can see them on the leaderboard and when i fight them they are invisible, so i reached out to arrascord, and apparently you have to stay 5 minutes in the pumpkin patch or so, im gonna test this right now and come back, it seems like its true, you have to stay inside for like a minute, it will give you 3 warnings before cursing you, now it seems like i became permanently invisible and i got 1 shotted after by a single bullet? lemme try again... so, yes, turns out theres another advantage, if you stay in the pumpkins for too long you get: permanent invisibility, generators powering off no longer affect you, you can always see everything, butttt you get one shoted by everything, which is no good, though, if youre in the pumpkin patch, this doesnt apply to you, so getting this curse while you only want to stay in the pumpkin patch is good, because theres no con, but the 2 advantages you get are kinda useless, always visible is only useful in the mansion, and permanent invisibility is already in the pumpkin patch

i timed it and it takes 2mins and 30secs being in the Pumpkin Patch to get the orang color
messages while getting the orang color:

1min: "You feel an ominious aura from the Pumpkin Patch. Maybe you shouldn't stay here for too long."

1min 30s: "You feel your soul slowly being ripped out of your body, Are you sure you want to stay in the Pumpkin Patch?"

2mins: "You feel a curse being placed upon you. If you leave now though, it might not be too late."

2min 30s: "You have been cursed to become the one with the pumpkins. You look down at your body and only your fragile soul remains."

gameplay as orang: now when i say you get one shotted by everything, i mean everything, single vulcan bullet, tiny manufacture bullet, if youre a rammer, dont even try, ramming anything immediately kills you, though, the only place you want to be in is the mansion, you're permanently invisible, and you can see through all the darkness, while your enemy wonders how the fuck do they see me, where the fuck are they, this is only when the enemy cant hit you, and youre probably a droner, and at that part of the mansion, the light are turned off, otherwise, i do not recommend becoming orang for serious scoring, but you should definitely try it out
